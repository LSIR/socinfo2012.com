    Dirk Helbing has worked as Managing Director of the Institute for Transport &amp; Economics at TU Dresden and is now <strong>Professor of Sociology, in particular of Modeling and Simulation at ETH Zurich</strong>. Having studied physics and mathematics, he investigates complex social, economic, and transport systems with methods from statistical physics, individual-based models, and behavioral experiments. Helbing is well-known for the social force model, in particular its application to self-organization phenomena in pedestrian crowds. Besides the slower-is-faster effect, he introduced the freezing-by-heating effect and the phase diagram of congested traffic states. Recent work applies principles of collective intelligence and dynamics to the optimization of freeway and urban traffic flows. In game theory, Helbing proposed a microscopic foundation of evolutionary game theory and studied self-organized behavioral conventions early on. His current work develops socio-inspired technologies and investigates the role of success-driven motion for the establishment of cooperation among selfish individuals.

    Bernardo A. Huberman is a <strong>Senior HP Fellow and director of the Social Computing Research Group at HP Labs</strong>, which focuses on methods for harvesting the collective intelligence of groups of people in order to realize greater value from the interaction between users and information.
    Hubermanâ€™s main research focus is on the relationship between local actions and the global behavior of large, distributed systems. Areas of exploration include distributed knowledge, social organizations and the economics of attention.
    Much of Huberman's research has concentrated on the World Wide Web, with an emphasis on the dynamics of its growth and use. This work helped uncover the nature of electronic markets, the detailed structure of the web and the laws governing the way people surf for information. One of the originators of the field of ecology of computation, Huberman recently published the book, "The Laws of the Web: Patterns in the Ecology of Information," with MIT Press.

    Prof. Dr. Andreas Ernst achieved his psychology Diplom degree with a focus on psychology of knowledge/cognitive science in 1988. He finished his PhD&mdash;entitled "Social knowledge as basis of decisions in conflict situations"&mdash;in 1993.

    Until 1999 he was assistant professor at the Institute of Psychology, University of Freiburg i. Br. and in the same year he finished his postdoctoral lecture qualification under the title: "Information dilemmas and the use of natural resources". After another three years at the Institute of Psychology, University of Freiburg i.Br. he became <strong>full professor for Environmental Systems Analysis at the Center for Environmental Systems Research of the University of Kassel</strong>.

    He also heads the Graduate Program "Man-Environment-Systems" (ProMUS) and is the current president of the European Social Simulation Association (ESSA). Prof. Dr. Andreas Ernst is co-editor of the book series "Social Science Simulations" of the Metropolis-Verlag.
